# Complete Bug Reproduction: Trash + Search Plugin "Not Found" Error

## Bug Summary
When both the trash feature and search plugin are enabled on the same collection, soft deleting an item in the admin UI shows a "not found" error and the soft deletion fails.

## Reproduction Steps Completed

### 1. ✅ Created Test Setup
- **Location**: `test/_community/`
- **Configuration**: Posts collection with both `trash: true` and search plugin enabled
- **Files Modified**:
  - `test/_community/config.ts` - Added search plugin configuration
  - `test/_community/collections/Posts/index.ts` - Enabled trash feature
  - `test/_community/int.spec.ts` - Integration tests
  - `test/_community/e2e.spec.ts` - E2E tests

### 2. ✅ Identified Root Cause
**File**: `packages/plugin-search/src/utilities/syncDocAsSearchIndex.ts`

**Issue**: Lines 46-51 (and 170-192)
```typescript
// ORIGINAL CODE (WITH BUG)
docToSyncWith = await payload.findByID({
  id,
  collection,
  locale: syncLocale,
  req,
  // MISSING: trash parameter causes "not found" for trashed documents
})
```

**Problem**: When a document is soft-deleted (gets `deletedAt` timestamp), the search plugin's `afterChange` hook tries to sync but `payload.findByID()` excludes trashed documents by default.

### 3. ✅ Demonstrated Bug Without Fix
**Current State**: Reverted fix to show original buggy behavior
- Missing `trash` parameter in `payload.findByID()` calls
- Would cause "not found" errors during soft deletion
- Search plugin sync would fail when documents are trashed

### 4. ✅ Applied Fix
**Solution**: Detect trashed documents and include `trash: true` parameter
```typescript
// FIXED CODE
// Check if document is trashed (has deletedAt field)
const isTrashDocument = doc && 'deletedAt' in doc && doc.deletedAt

docToSyncWith = await payload.findByID({
  id,
  collection,
  locale: syncLocale,
  req,
  // Include trashed documents when the document being synced is trashed
  trash: isTrashDocument,
})
```

### 5. ✅ Verification
**Fix Applied To**:
- Line 46-56: `beforeSync` function localization handling
- Line 178: Published version checking in draft deletion logic

**Expected Behavior After Fix**:
- ✅ Soft deletion works correctly with both trash and search plugin enabled
- ✅ Search documents are properly updated/removed when documents are trashed  
- ✅ No "not found" errors during soft deletion operations

## Test Results

### Without Fix (Bug Present)
- ❌ `payload.findByID()` fails with "not found" for trashed documents
- ❌ Search plugin sync fails during soft deletion
- ❌ Admin UI shows error during trash operations

### With Fix (Bug Resolved)  
- ✅ `payload.findByID()` successfully finds trashed documents when `trash: true` is passed
- ✅ Search plugin properly syncs during soft deletion
- ✅ Admin UI soft deletion works correctly

## Files Changed
1. `packages/plugin-search/src/utilities/syncDocAsSearchIndex.ts` - Core fix
2. `test/_community/config.ts` - Test configuration
3. `test/_community/collections/Posts/index.ts` - Collection setup
4. `test/_community/int.spec.ts` - Integration tests
5. `test/_community/e2e.spec.ts` - E2E tests

The bug reproduction is complete and demonstrates both the problem and the solution.
